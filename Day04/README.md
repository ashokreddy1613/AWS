# VPC Endpoint in AWS
A VPC endpoint allows private connections between your VPC and AWS services like S3, DynamoDB etc without using:
    - The public internet
    - NAT Gateway
    - VPN
    - Transit Gateway

It enables secure, fast, and cost-effective access to AWS services over the AWS private network.

Imagine a scenario where you have deployed highly secure application within a VPC in your AWS account, this application needs  to securly access AWS S3 without exposing it to public internet. You can use Endpoints to eshtablish the connection.

Types of Endpoints:
    1. Interface Endpoint
        Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in your subnet that connects to AWS service (e.g., SSM, Secrets Manager, EC2 API)
    2. Gateway Endpoint
        Route table entry for S3 or DynamoDB ‚Äî no ENI involved

# üß± Real-World Examples
1. üîí Accessing S3 from a Private Subnet Without NAT Gateway

Problem:
You're in a private subnet and want to access S3. Normally, you'd need a NAT Gateway.

Solution:
Use a Gateway VPC Endpoint for S3:
    - No NAT
    - No internet
    - Still can read/write S3 securely
